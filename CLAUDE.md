## 2026-03-15 Notes
- Meeting detail now supports structured minutes editing through a separate \\meeting_minutes\\ table.
- Keep meeting metadata in \\meetings\\ and operational content in \\meeting_minutes\\ for additive expansion toward tasks and AI plugins.
- Supabase MCP verification confirmed tables and RLS policies, but remote migration history was not updated by the direct MCP SQL execution path.
- Frontend meeting minutes edit permission now mirrors RLS scope: admins can edit any meeting, and team leaders can edit only meetings in departments they lead.
- New meeting creation was streamlined so users can save the meeting record and structured minutes together from the create form.

## 2026-03-26 Notes
- Report edit persistence now uses a non-destructive child-row replacement pattern for programs, newcomers, and project child tables.
- Preserve existing child rows until replacement writes succeed; avoid delete-first behavior in edit mode.
- Verification for this change passed with `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Report draft/save persistence now also routes through `POST /api/reports/save` for shared server-side orchestration.

## 2026-03-26 Notes - Transactional Report Save RPC
- `POST /api/reports/save` now uses a DB RPC-backed persistence path for the core report bundle instead of only JavaScript orchestration.
- Added migration `supabase/migrations/006_save_report_bundle_rpc.sql` for `public.save_report_bundle(payload jsonb)`.
- Keep server cookie auth and current permission checks in the route layer; keep notification creation in the server app layer after DB save success.
- `attendance_records` remains warning-tolerant inside the RPC so report save can still succeed when attendance persistence fails independently.
- Added focused tests for duplicate response handling, edit-save path, attendance warning propagation, and autosave target update routing.
- Remote Supabase verification now confirms `public.save_report_bundle` exists in `public`.

## 2026-03-26 Notes - Report Save Boundary Hardening
- POST /api/reports/save permission preflight now validates targetReportId draft updates with the same author/admin/status rule used for editReportId.
- src/components/reports/hooks/useReportSubmit.ts now treats the route as the main app-layer authority for edit permission instead of doing a separate blocking client role lookup first.
- saveReportViaApi now downgrades malformed or text error responses into structured ok: false payloads for safer client handling.
- Autosave and explicit submit now run through a small exclusive queue to reduce intra-form save races.
## 2026-03-26 Notes - Final Report Save Boundary Consistency
- POST /api/reports/save now rejects dual-id requests (editReportId + 	argetReportId) before persistence so route validation and DB write target stay aligned.
- src/components/reports/hooks/useReportSubmit.ts now returns explicit autosave result states and src/components/reports/ReportForm.tsx no longer shows a false autosave error when submit intentionally suppresses autosave.
- Verification passed with focused report-save tests, full 
pm test, 
px tsc --noEmit, and 
pm run build.

## 2026-03-26 Notes - Proxy Rename
- Replaced the deprecated root Next.js entry src/middleware.ts with src/proxy.ts.
- Keep using src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts for the actual Supabase session update logic; this was a file-convention change only.

## 2026-04-18 Notes - MRO DX/AX Reference
- Added `docs/reference/mro-dx-ax-reference.md` for portfolio/submission use.
- The document summarizes architecture, core implementation areas, AX-ready extension points, and screenshot guidance without changing application behavior.

## 2026-06-01 Notes - Meeting PDF Attachments
- New meeting creation supports attaching a PDF minutes file to the meeting.
- `meeting_minutes` now carries PDF metadata (`pdf_file_path`, `pdf_file_name`, `pdf_file_size`, `pdf_uploaded_at`) and the file itself lives in the private `meeting-pdfs` Supabase Storage bucket.
- Meeting detail reads the stored path, creates a signed URL, and embeds the PDF for viewing.
- Existing report approval logic and notification flow were not changed.

## 2026-06-01 Notes - Report Delete and Feedback
- Report list/detail now expose delete actions for users allowed by the existing report management permission rules.
- Report feedback is stored separately in `report_feedback` and is available to `super_admin`, `president`, and `accountant` without touching approval state.
- Keep the approval workflow unchanged; feedback is an additive side channel, not a new approval step.

## 2026-06-01 Notes - Meeting Delete and Feedback
- Meeting list/detail now expose delete actions for users who can edit the meeting content.
- Meeting feedback is stored separately in `meeting_feedback` and is available to `super_admin`, `president`, and `accountant`.
- Meetings do not use the report approval flow; feedback is only a comment trail and should stay separate from status/state logic.

## 2026-06-11 Notes - CU1 Attendance And Approval Operations
- Attendance screen reads absent rows as well as present rows, preventing duplicate-key failures when a previously unchecked attendance row is checked again.
- Attendance writes now use explicit Supabase error handling and `onConflict: member_id,attendance_date,attendance_type` upsert where appropriate.
- Bulk attendance actions respect the current cell filter and roll back UI state if the write fails.
- Data operations for Do Jisu/Dahui cell, Park Cheolho/Mina cell, and CU1 pending cell-leader report bulk approval are prepared in `scripts/ops-2026-06-11-cu1-request.sql`.
- Existing attendance/report/accounting/auth/RLS structures remain unchanged; production SQL still needs a fresh Supabase PAT/MCP connection because the cached token is unauthorized.

## 2026-06-18 Notes - Meeting Agenda Discussion
- Meeting detail includes a pre-meeting agenda discussion board through `src/components/meetings/MeetingAgendaBoard.tsx`.
- Schema extension lives in `supabase/migrations/012_add_meeting_agenda_discussion.sql` and adds `meeting_agenda_items` plus `meeting_agenda_comments`.
- Agenda participation is intentionally broader than meeting-content editing: active `super_admin`, `president`, `accountant`, and department leaders can post items/comments.
- Keep this separate from `meeting_minutes` and `meeting_feedback`; it is for pre-meeting coordination, not approval or finalized minutes.

## 2026-06-18 Notes - Meeting Edit And Cancel Actions
- Meeting detail now has explicit `수정` and `제출 취소` text buttons for users who can edit/delete the meeting.
- `제출 취소` deletes the meeting bundle because meetings do not have the report approval status lifecycle.
- `supabase/migrations/013_add_meeting_update_policy.sql` adds authorized update RLS for `meetings`.

## 2026-06-18 Notes - Department Agenda PDF Attachments
- `supabase/migrations/014_add_meeting_agenda_pdf_attachments.sql` extends `meeting_agenda_items` with PDF metadata.
- Agenda PDFs reuse the private `meeting-pdfs` bucket and are stored under `agenda/{meetingId}/{departmentId}/...`.
- Keep agenda PDFs separate from meeting minutes PDFs; they are source material for department agenda discussion.

## 2026-06-19 Notes - Meeting Team Leader Feedback And Agenda PDF RLS Fix
- `supabase/migrations/015_fix_meeting_team_leader_feedback_and_agenda_pdf.sql` aligns meeting feedback insert RLS with meeting creator/department team leader permissions.
- Meeting detail uses `canLeaveMeetingFeedback` so team leaders see the feedback form when RLS will allow the insert.
- Agenda PDF Storage policies now explicitly evaluate `agenda/{meetingId}/{departmentId}/...` paths for department team leader access.

## 2026-06-19 Notes - Meeting Agenda Participant Leader Permission
- `supabase/migrations/016_allow_meeting_agenda_participant_leaders.sql` aligns pre-meeting agenda RLS with the leader-meeting workflow.
- Active `team_leader` users can post agenda items for departments linked in `user_departments`, even when that link is not marked `is_team_leader = true`.
- Active `team_leader` users can comment on agenda items, and agenda PDF Storage policies use the same linked-department rule.
- This is intentionally scoped to the pre-meeting agenda board and does not change meeting minutes edit/delete permissions.

## 2026-06-19 Notes - Meeting Agenda And Comment Edit
- `src/components/meetings/MeetingAgendaBoard.tsx` now exposes inline edit controls for agenda item title/type/content and comment text.
- `src/queries/meetings/useMeetings.ts` includes update mutations for `meeting_agenda_items` and `meeting_agenda_comments`.
- `supabase/migrations/017_add_meeting_agenda_edit_policies.sql` adds explicit update RLS for agenda items/comments.
- Keep this scoped to pre-meeting discussion; do not broaden finalized minutes edit/delete permissions from this change.

## 2026-06-22 Notes - Meeting Agenda Edit UX
- `src/components/meetings/MeetingAgendaBoard.tsx` now makes long agenda edits less cumbersome by hiding the read-only body/PDF preview while edit mode is open.
- Agenda item edit fields appear directly near the item header, autofocus the title, use larger dynamic textareas, and support Ctrl/Cmd+Enter save.
- Comment edit fields use the same autofocus/dynamic textarea/Ctrl-Cmd-Enter pattern.
- This is UI-only and keeps existing update mutations, RLS, auth, attendance, report, accounting, meeting minutes, and feedback behavior unchanged.

## 2026-06-24 Notes - Report Title And Agenda Comment UX
- `src/app/(dashboard)/reports/new/page.tsx` keeps report creation labels and the page title in readable Korean to avoid mojibake in the report creation header.
- `src/components/meetings/MeetingAgendaBoard.tsx` now groups comment `수정` and `삭제` actions together on the right side of the comment header.
- `src/queries/meetings/useMeetings.ts` now applies immediate TanStack Query cache updates for agenda comment create/update/delete before invalidating the agenda query.
- Scope is limited to display text, comment row layout, and client cache freshness; no auth, RLS, DB schema, attendance, report save, or accounting flow changes.

## 2026-06-29 Notes - Report Photo Visibility And Submit Guard
- `src/queries/reports.ts` now includes `useReportPhotos`, reading `report_photos` for the report detail view.
- `src/components/reports/ReportDetail.tsx` displays attached report photos in a dedicated section before the approval status section.
- `src/components/reports/hooks/useReportSubmit.ts` now treats report photo upload or metadata insert failures as visible submit failures instead of silently logging them.
- `src/components/reports/ReportForm.tsx` blocks implicit Enter-key form submission and requires the explicit submit button for report submission.
- `src/components/photos/PhotosClient.tsx` now cleans up newly uploaded Storage files if `department_photos` metadata insert fails, and checks delete errors instead of ignoring them.
- `scripts/audit-photo-integrity.sql` can be run from Supabase SQL Editor to compare photo table rows with Storage objects.
- Remote Storage inspection confirmed existing files in both photo buckets, but table row verification needs authenticated/service-role access.
- No auth, RLS, database schema, attendance, accounting, or approval workflow changes were introduced.
